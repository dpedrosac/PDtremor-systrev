## About this Project
### Introduction
Idiopathic Parkinson syndrome (iPS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the triad of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. 
Tremor at rest predominantly at one side is often perceived by patients as severely disabling and yet ranges among the most difficult symptoms to treat. 
In medically refractory cases, lesional approaches have proven to be effective alternatives. However, to date, there is no comprehensive analysis of 
non-surgical therapies to manage iPS-patients’ tremor. This repository summarises all steps of the data acquisition, extraction and analyses.
